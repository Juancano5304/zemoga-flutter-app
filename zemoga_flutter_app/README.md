## About myself

I'm a 30 years old Flutter developer from the city of Medellín, Colombia; which is enthusiastic on current mobile development. With almost 6 years of mobile experience focused in Android native Apps, this year, I decided to give a chance to my career considering my professional knowledge into going deeper on Flutter world; such a goal makes me excited just about thinking how I'll perform what consider such beautiful apps to work with. So far, I've worked on:
* Animations
* Testing
* MVVM
* Clean Architecture
* Provider
* Routing
* And a lot of libraries and dependencies such as:
  * Dio
  * Http
  * ImagePicker

## Architecture

The only purpose what I develop this application on Clean Architecture is about to probe that i'm able to understand the SOLID principles, as well as this Bussiness orientated architecture

## Some features about the app

* The app is able to load post list from chache or from network source.
* The post list could be reloaded with dragging down the list
* The post could be deleted with a swipe
* To add to favorites press the star to the right side

## State Managment

I used Provider as state managment since it's my strongest skill. I've worked with MVVM architecture, nevertheless, I have knowledge on Cubit and Bloc which I've never used before as I do on Getx.

## Unit Testing

I made some unit testing about models, repositories and datasources, including network verification and cache validation. My skills also outstand on widget and testing integration, however such skills are not included because there's not enough time to invest in currently.

## Thanks

Thanks for the oportunity to give a chance in Zemoga
