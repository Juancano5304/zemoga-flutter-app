## About myself

I'm a Flutter developer from Medellin, Colombia, with 30 years old i'm very entusiatic about the mobile development. With almost 6 years of mobile experience mostly in Android native Apps i decide this year to give a change to my career and introduce into the Flutter world and i'm really happy to be able to perform such a beautiful apps.
I had worked on:
* Animations
* Testing
* MVVM
* Clean Architecture
* Provider
* Routing
* And a lot of libraries and dependencies as:
  * Dio
  * Http
  * ImagePicker

## Architecture

I decided to build this application on Clean Architecture only with the purpose that probe that i'm able to understand SOLID principles and this Bussiness orientated architecture.

## State Managment

I used Provider as state managment because is my strongest skill. Also i had been worked with MVVM architecture nevertheless i have the knowledge of cubit and bloc but never used before same as getx.

## Unit Testing

I made some unit testing about models, repositories and datasources, including network verification and cache validation. Also have skills with widget and integration testing but is not included because of the limited time.

## Thanks
